## Hotel Management App: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Hotel Management App for Android!

This is Hotel Management App available on Google Play for hotel industry business uses only.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app for business uses.User data like Name,Phone number,Aadhar card,Pan card etc is collected by business and it cannot be deleted because its mandatory to keep records of these data. Whereas if business dont want keep this data then can easily be deleted by contacting to developer team.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
